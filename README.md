# startup-app

// ***** IMPORTANT ***** //

I used handlebars starter from "https://github.com/maksabuzyarov/gulp-webpack-handlebars".

I have designed the website from figma project.

Figma project: "https://www.figma.com/file/7l1Ar0sPDERTOqMYBqElAp/Landing-Page---Startup-App?node-id=960%3A1013"

Since this project has multiple modules, I used them randomly.

Links inside submenu content are not filled, they don't have directory, they are working, but I just simply didn't fill them with links because of the figma design, there is no module for them.

// ***** HOW TO RUN ***** //

1. Enter the directory with cmd.
2. Run "npm install" to install node modules.
3. Run "npm run build" to compile production build.

// If you want dev build, run "gulp".
